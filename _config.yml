              I am a motivated and multi-talented **Security Engineer** with a background in **Software Engineering and Cloud Technologies** w/ AWS, GCP 
              and Akamai Cloud. I have built numerous automations in and around security products and configurations using Python and Golang. 
              I am well versed in Infrastructure-as-Code and have managed AWS Infrastructure in a medium sized company. I possess good knowledge of security
              protocols, practices, and tools - which allows me to contribute to security discussion and architecture of various products. I am also
              an avid home-labber, and engage in **Threat Intel, Malware Reversing, and Application Security** in my free time. I also engage with
              and mentor students at my alma mater and in my hometown in Nepal in the field of cybersecurity
