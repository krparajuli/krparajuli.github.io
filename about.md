I am a motivated and multi-talented Security Engineer with a background in Software Engineering and Cloud Technologies. I have
built numerous automations in and around security products and configurations using Python and Golang. I am well versed in
Infrastructure-as-Code and have managed AWS Infrastructure in a medium sized company. I possess good knowledge of security
protocols, practices, and tools - which allows me to contribute to security discussion and architecture of various products. I am also
an avid home-labber, and engage in Threat Intel, Malware Reversing, and Application Security in my free time. I also engage with
and mentor students at my alma mater and in my hometown in Nepal in the field of cybersecurity.
