|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Samba|< 4.13.17|SMB|`vfs_fruit`|**Out-of-bounds heap read/write**|CVE-2021-44142|9.9|

The `vfs_fruit` module that ships with Samba is designed to provide interoperability between Samba and Netatalk. With Netatalk being an open-source implementation of the AFP — Apple Filing Protocol — which is used to converse with macOS clients. When everything's in place and working, it allows Unix-like systems to serve as file servers for Apple devices. Once a session is established, smbd — the SMB daemon — allows an unauthenticated user to set extended file attributes and therein lies the problem. [[5]](https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-857-notes.pdf)

**vfs_fruit** -  The vfs_fruit module provides enhanced compatibility with Apple SMB clients and interoperability with a Netatalk 3 AFP fileserver.[[2]](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/vfs_fruit.8.html)
**Netatalk** - Netatalk is a freely-available Open Source AFP fileserver. A UNIX, Linux or BSD system running Netatalk is capable of serving many Macintosh clients simultaneously as an AppleShare file server (AFP - Apple Filing Protocol).[[3]](http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/)
**AFS** - The Apple Filing Protocol (AFP), formerly AppleTalk Filing Protocol, is a proprietary network protocol, and part of the Apple File Service (AFS)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Filing_Protocol)

All versions of Samba prior to 4.13.17 are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds heap read write vulnerability that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code as root on affected Samba installations that use the VFS module vfs_fruit.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of EA metadata when opening files in smbd. Access as a user that has write access to a file's extended attributes is required to exploit this vulnerability. Note that this could be a guest or unauthenticated user if such users are allowed write access to file extended attributes.

The problem in vfs_fruit exists in the default configuration of the fruit VFS module using fruit:metadata=netatalk or fruit:resource=file. If both options are set to different settings than the default values, the system is not affected by the security issue.[[1]](https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2021-44142.html)
