TLS certificates usually contain the following information:

* The subject domain name
* The subject organization
* The name of the issuing CA
* Additional or alternative subject domain names, including subdomains, if any
* Issue date
* Expiry date
* The public key (The private key, however, is a secret.)
* The digital signature by the CA
